# Movie-Recomender
A content-based movie recommendation engine that suggests the top 5 movies similar to a user's selection. The system analyzes movie metadata and provides a visually engaging interface with real-time poster fetching using the TMDB API.


Developed an AI-driven movie recommender using Python and Scikit-learn, utilizing Cosine Similarity to suggest films based on content similarity.

Built a "Netflix-style" UI in Streamlit, integrating the TMDB API to dynamically render posters while resolving complex data mapping issues between IMDb and TMDB datasets.

Optimized data retrieval using caching and implemented robust error-handling protocols to ensure a 100% success rate in API calls and data indexing.
